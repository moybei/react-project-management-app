# Project Management App

Welcome to the **Project Management App**! This application allows you to create and manage projects with task lists, helping you keep track of your work. It's a great tool for personal or small team project management.

## Features

- **Create New Projects**: Easily add new projects to your dashboard.
- **Add Task Lists to Projects**: Organize your tasks by creating task lists under each project.
- **Delete Projects and Tasks**: Remove projects or individual tasks when they are completed or no longer needed.

## Current Limitation

⚠️ **Data Persistence**: Currently, the app only uses state to manage data. This means that any data (projects, tasks) will be lost when you reload the page. Future updates will include persistent storage, allowing your data to be saved even after closing the browser.
